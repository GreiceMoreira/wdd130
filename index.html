            <p>Hello! My name is Greice Franceschetti de Andrade Moreira and I am from Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. <br>
                I enjoy playing video games and watching Korean dramas.  <br>
                I teach at a kindergarten in Quebec City, Canada.  <br>
                I started studying web development in 2020; however, 
                I have never had the chance to work with it.  <br>
                I hope that obtaining a degree will change that. </p>

            <p>Rio Grande do Sul ("Great River of the South") is a state in the southern region of Brazil. It is the fifth-most populous state and the ninth-largest by area. <br>
                The state shares a gaucho culture with its neighbors Argentina and Uruguay. Large waves of German and Italian migration have shaped the state as well.
